# Project Title

**AcTrack**

## Overview

The To-Do Web App is a task management tool that allows users to create, manage, and organize their short and long term tasks efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface to help users prioritize their daily activities and improve productivity.

### Problem Space

In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to keep track of their tasks and responsibilities. Traditional methods such as pen and paper are prone to being lost or forgotten. This app addresses the need for a reliable digital solution that helps users stay organized, reduces stress, and enhances time management as well as reduce procrastination habits.


### User Profile

- The primary users of this app are professionals, students, family, friends and anyone looking to manage their tasks more effectively. Users will interact with the app through a web interface where they can add, delete, and edit tasks. Special considerations include ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities and providing a responsive design for use on various devices.
